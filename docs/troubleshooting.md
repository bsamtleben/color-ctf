**Spoiler alert:** There is no debug output when the virtual machines are provisioned since this would provide a lot of information about the setup of the machines and could reveal how to solve them.

Nevertheless, if a machine cannot be started or stopped and the error message is not helpful, you can check the log file stored at `machines/vagrant.log`. Just be aware that it might contain spoilers.
