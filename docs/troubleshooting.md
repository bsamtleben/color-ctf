# Troubleshooting

⚠️ **Spoiler alert:** There is no debug output when the virtual machines are provisioned since this would provide a lot of information about the setup and could reveal how to solve them.

Nevertheless, if a machine cannot be started or stopped and the error message is not helpful, you can check out the log file stored at `machines/vagrant.log`. Just be aware that it might spoil the challenge.
